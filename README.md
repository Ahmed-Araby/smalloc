# What is dynamic memory allocation
dynamic memory refer to the so called 'heap' and it is the area that comes after the .bss (un initialized data area) and grow,
in the direction of increasing memory addresses.

![memory layout](https://github.com/Ahmed-Araby/malloc/blob/main/images/memory-layout.png)

the kernal keeps an internal pointer called 'brk' per process to track the heap top, at the very begining (when the process just started before any dynamic memory allocation requests) the size of the heap is zero bytes and 'brk' points at the '.bss' area top.

linux provide a sys call called 'brk' which could be used to extend / shrink the heap, how ever such use is not conventional or practical, as there is more to do with the heap than just extending or shrinking.
as we know (and do, in our day to day use of relatively low level langauge like c and c++) we can allocate different size area of the heap to our usage,
and free theses areas when ever we are done with them, so we need to re-use the area we freed for future allocations, unless there is no free area within 
the heap we can ask the kernal to for more memory to extend the heap.

so there is alot to do with the heap memory
 * allocate memory from the heap for our application code use
 * free the memory used by the application code when application code wants.
 * re-use the previously freed memory when possible for future memory allocation request
 * ask the kernal for more memory to extend the heap when needed.

and all of this has to be done in efficient(fast) manner and make maximum possible utilization of the heap memory(reduce external/internal fragmentation).

so we need some kind of reusbale code to take care of theses functionalities for our application code, and this is called "Dynamic Memory Allocators", 
for example the C programming lanague provide package(as part of the std library) called 'malloc' that manage the heap memory.

internally this package will make use of wrapper functions brk/sbrk implemented by C std lib which by their turn will interact with the kernal
sys call 'brk', also it could make use of 'mmap' and 'munmap' sys calls, they can achieve the same goals

Dynamic Memory Allocators has 2 types 'Explicit' and 'Implicit':
* 'Explicit Dyanmic Memory Allocators' will free allocated areas from the heap to be re-usbale only when the application code asks for (this is called manual memory management).
* 'Implicit Dynamic Memory Allocators' will keep track of the references to the allocated memory and free the area that has no references any more (this is called garabe collection).

this project implements an "Explicit Dynamic Memory Allocator".

# Design
example of heap memory area with the footprints 
![heap structure](https://github.com/Ahmed-Araby/malloc/blob/main/images/heap-structure.png)

aspects of the design for an 'Explicit Dynamic Memory Allocator'
* how to keep track / manage the heap memory.
    
    in my implementation I used "implicit free list" which just a bunch of memory footprints that surround heap blocks (allocated / free), 
    and theses memory footprints contains meta data about the block (size and allocated or not) and we can use the size (works as implicit pointer)     to navigate the heap memory blocks.
    
* memory padding / allignment
  
    this allocator force the heap memory to be double word alligned where word equls 4 bytes and this mean that the size of any block (allocated / free) must be multiple of double word (=16 bytes) and block size include every thing about the block (header, footer, payload and padding), also allocation requests should be rounded up to the nerest multiple of double word, one of the reasons for such a constraint is to make sure that there is always a space for the header and footer as our header/footer are of word size each hence total is double word.
    
* what is the structure of the heap block (allocated or free).

![heap block structure](https://github.com/Ahmed-Araby/malloc/blob/main/images/heap-block-structure.png)

* algorithm used to find suitable block for allocation request.
    
    first fit alogirthm.
    
* how to handle internal fragmentation when the heap block to be allocated is bigger than the requestd size.
  
    split the extra memory into a new free block, and because the size to be allocated is multiple of double word and the current block area to be allocated has size that is multiple of double word, then the free size will also be multiple of double word, however we should only split when the extra area are more than double word other wise we will have free block with enough space for header and footer but no payload, also we should set some limit on the extra memory that we should split other wise we will end up with small free blocks which will make the heap navigation more expensive, as the complexity of navigating the heap is O(# of blocks).
    
* how to handle free requests to avoid falsy external fragementation.
    
    we should try to coalesce the block to be freed with the next neighbour block (if free) and the previous neighbour block (if free), coalescing is the act of merging 2 free blocks into one bigger free block.

* public API and internal functions that manage the heap 

    I made this diagram to help me with order on which I should start to implement the allocator functions, I guess it could give a clear idea about what to expect from the allocator public API and how does the internal works

# Usage
with the follwing assumpations
* you run linux ( I use ubuntu)
* you have gcc installed 
* you have valgrind installed, why valgrind? we will use valgrind to make sure that memory locations we writing/reading to/from are actually allocated hence our Dynamic memory allocator works fine, as some times your C process can start writing/reading  to/from memory areas without beaing allocated and you will have no clue, also valgrind will tell us weather we have memory leaks or not hence we can make sure that the library deallocate memory correctly.
* you are not using the 'malloc' package from the C std library as the C package and my package are making use (implicitly) of the 'brk' pointer which is maintained by the kernal, hence the behaviour will be undefined.
* you cloned this repo
* your terminal sets inside the main repo directory
* the file you wrote in the C code that will use this library is called "main.c" and located in the repo main directory (after you clone offcourse)

to allocate and free memory

```
#include "malloc.h"

int 
main(){
    int *arr = mmalloc(4 * sizeof(int)); // take size in bytes
    /*
    * you can play with the memory you have here
    * write/read to/from it and see valgrind output.
    * also you can comment the mfree(arr) line and see the memory leak report from valgrind.
    */
    mfree(arr);
}
```

then write the following in the terminal

```
gcc main.c malloc.c -Wall -o main
valgrind ./main
```

also there are some example files that make use of the library in the "usage" folder

# Implementation Details
* why we are not using the very first block (of word size) in the heap ?
    
    because we will always use the very last block of size word in the heap as some thing called 'Epilogue' block (see bellow for more explanation on what is 'Epilogue' block).
    
    but still why we are not using the first block of the heap ? 
    
    okay, because our heap is double word aligned and we will use the last word block as 'Epilogue block' we need to drop another word block to keep our heap double word aligned hence we are not making use of the first word block of the heap, in case our heap was aligned to 4 words which is 2 double words then we will need to drop 3 words block to keep our heap memory compliant with the alignment constraints.
    
* why memory allignment and padding (in our case Double Word allignment, and word is 4 bytes) ?
    
    I believe but not sure (if you have input on this just throw it on me please) that, the allignment is choosen based on the memory footprint and it is job is to make sure there is always space for the footprint in our case our memory footprint for any block is a header of size word and a footer of size word hence aside from the 'Prologue' block and 'Epilogute' block and the un-used very first block we have double word footprint per heap block (free or allcoated), hence our allignment.
    
* what is the use of the Prologue block ?
    
    I believe but not sure (if you have input on this just throw it on me please) that it is there to eliminate the corner case where we want to colease the first free heap block with the previous block, if we did not have the 'Prologue' block we will face the unused word block of the heap and we would need to handle this corner case, also the 'Prologue' block will always be marked as allocated to stop the colease operation.
    
* what is the use of the Epilogue block ?
    
    used as mark for the end of the heap memory and also it is helpful when we are trying to colease the last free block with the next block which will be the 'Epilogue' block if we did not have the 'Epilogue' block we will need to handle such corner case, I also use it to stop the navigation on the heap and as a mark that there is no fit free block (as I am using first fit algorithm)  for the allocation request
    
* why do we have footer in the heap blocks ?

    to handle colease operation with previous neighbout block, then we can use the footer of the previous neighbour block to get meta data and locate the header of the previous neighbour block.
    
* why spliting extra memory could be bad ?

    as this extra memory could be very small and the chance it will fit futrue allocation request will be low, hence all we got is more blocks in the heap which make the heap navigation using the 'implicit free list' slower as the navigation complexity is O(# of heap blocks)
    
* what other options exist for the heap block structure (memory footprint) ? [To Be ANSWERED]
* what other options exist to manage the heap memory other than the implicit free list ? [To Be ANSWERED]

# TODO
- [ ] add some conditions to check for, before spliting the extra space of the block to be allocated.
- [ ] reduce the heap block footprint by using the trick of adding only footer for the the free blocks
- [ ] try different structure other than the 'implicit free list' to manage the heap memory.
- [ ] add calloc functionality.
- [ ] add realloc functionality.
